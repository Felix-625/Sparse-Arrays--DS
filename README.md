 The matchingStrings function iterates through each query and uses the Count method with a lambda expression to count how many times the query appears in stringList, storing the counts in a results list. The Main method reads the number of input strings and queries, collects them into lists, then calls matchingStrings and outputs the results. The code efficiently uses built-in LINQ functions to simplify counting and maintains a clear separation between input/output handling and the core logic. Overall, it provides a straightforward and effective solution for counting string occurrences.
